# Shopify_Intern_Challenge

* __Task__: Build the barebones of an online marketplace.<br/>

* Build a server side web api that can be used to fetch products either one at a time or all at once.<br/>

* Querying for all products should support passing an argument to only return products with avaliable inventory.<br/>

* Products should be able to be "purchased" which should reduce the inventory by 1.<br/>

*__Extra credit__*:

* Fit these product purchase into the context of a simple shopping cart.<br/>

* create a cart -> adding products to the cart -> completing the cart<br/>

* The cart should contain a list of all included products, a total dollar amount(the total value of all products), and product inventory shouldn't reduce until after a cart has been completed.

***

## Implementing Restful services in Python and Flask:

##### The products and shopping_carts will used HTTP methods as follow:
|  HTTP Method  |  URl  |  Examples  |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/products?avaliable=True |  Retrieve  list of products with avaliable inventory |
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/products/[product_id]  | Retrieve a product                 |
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts         | Retrieve a list of shopping_carts  |
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts/[cart_id]  | Retrieve a shopping_cart id and the total value of products
|      PUT      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/products/[product_id]  | Update an existing product |
|      PUT      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts/[card_id]  | Update an existing shopping_cart |
|     POST      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts          | Create a new Shopping_cart |
|    DELETE     |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts/[cart_id]          | Delete a shopping_cart |
 
## Database:

* The Sqlite will be applied


|  Table  |    |    |   |     |     |   
|:-------------:|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|      product      |  id(primary)  |  title  |  price  |  inventory  |  relationships <br/>  __relationship('Relationship', backref='product', primaryjoin=id == Relationship.product_id)__  |
|      shoppingcart  |  id(primary)  |  relationships <br/>  __relationship('Relationship', backref='product', primaryjoin=id == Relationship.shoppingcart_id)__  | 
|      product_shoppingcart   |    shoppingcart_id(primary) <br/> __ForeignKey('product.id')__     |     product_id(primary) <br/> __ForeignKey('shoppingcart.id')__     |     quantity    |
