# Shopify_Intern_Challenge

* __Task__: Build the barebones of an online marketplace.<br/>

* Build a server side web api that can be used to fetch products either one at a time or all at once.<br/>

* Querying for all products should support passing an argument to only return products with avaliable inventory.<br/>

* Products should be able to be "purchased" which should reduce the inventory by 1.<br/>

*__Extra credit__*:

* Fit these product purchase into the context of a simple shopping cart.<br/>

* create a cart -> adding products to the cart -> completing the cart<br/>

* The cart should contain a list of all included products, a total dollar amount(the total value of all products), and product inventory shouldn't reduce until after a cart has been completed.

## Implementing Restful services in Python and Flask

##### The products and shopping_carts will used HTTP methods as follow:
|  HTTP Method  |  URl  |  Examples  |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/products?avaliable=True |  Retrieve  list of products with avaliable inventory |
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/products/[product_id]  | Retrieve a product                 |
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts         | Retrieve a list of shopping_carts  |
|      GET      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts/[cart_id]  | Retrieve a shopping_cart id and the total value of products
|      PUT      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/products/[product_id]  | Update an existing product |
|      PUT      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts/[card_id]  | Update an existing shopping_cart |
|     POST      |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts          | Create a new Shopping_cart |
|    DELETE     |  http://[hostname]/api/v1.0/shopping_carts/[cart_id]          | Delete a shopping_cart |
 
I will store our products and shopping_carts in a memory structrue. It runs the application is single thread and proccess. *It is inappropriate to develop it on a production web server, a proper databse setup must be used.*

 ```Python
products = {
    1: {
        'title': 'Apple',
        'price': 20,
        'inventory': 5,
    }
}

shopping_carts = {
    1: {
        'products': {1: 1, 3: 2}
    }
}
}
 ```
 
 To run application we have to execute web_api.py:
 ```
 FLASK_APP = web_api.py
FLASK_ENV = development
FLASK_DEBUG = 1
In folder D:/pythonFiles/Shopify_Challenge
D:\Anaconda3\envs\Shopify\python.exe -m flask run
 * Serving Flask app "web_api.py" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 347-854-976
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 ```

The __curl__ will be used for test web server, the command will be provided in each example.

#### Continuing....

1. Using proper set up database
2. Using lock to ensure syncrhonization
